# Algorithm Samples

Small C/C++ based project containing implementations of various algorithms and data structures.
For eductional purposes only.

#### Currently implemented
* C
	* vectors (dynamic array)
	* sorting (merge sort and insertion sort)
	* stacks
	* queues
	* trees
* C++
	* Digraphs (adjacency list)
	* BFS/DFS, topological sorting, shortest path, cycle detection

#### Todo:
* hash tables
* btrees
